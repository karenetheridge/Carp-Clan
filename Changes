Version history:
----------------

Version 5.7   02.10.2006
 +  Stop PAUSE from attempting to index DB package.

Version 5.6   02.10.2006

 +  Fixed test to predefined croak/confess/cluck/carp functions don't
    break tests.
 +  Use Object::Deadly even saner.
 +  Use named lexicals in diag().
 +  Skip testing import of carp/croak/cluck/confess if they existed
    prior to loading Carp::Clan.
 +  Use exists &foo/defined &foo instead of symbol table hackery.
 +  Remove all the symbol table hackery that had notes about avoiding
    symrefs. That's dumb. It's better to be clear and have symrefs
    than have unreadble code w/o symrefs.
 +  Remove gratituous & sigil on function calls.
 +  Changed f() so it accepts 1st parameter of carp/cluck/confess/croak
    instead of 1/2/3/4.
 +  Renamed files.
